# customer-transaction-prediction
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer will make a transaction (`1`) or not (`0`) in the future.

##  Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will make a future transaction using machine learning classification techniques.

##  Objectives
- Analyze customer transaction behavior
- Identify important predictive features
- Build and evaluate ML models

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

##  Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Cross Validation.

##  Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
